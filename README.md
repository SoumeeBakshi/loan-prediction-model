# loan-prediction-model

## OBJECTIVES
- Developed a loan prediction system using machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest.
- Applied data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques using Pandas and NumPy to prepare the dataset for training.
- Created visual analytics with Seaborn and Matplotlib to explore patterns and correlations within the dataset.
- Evaluated and compared model performance metrics to determine the most accurate and interpretable classifier
